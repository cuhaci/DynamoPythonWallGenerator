# DynamoPythonWallGenerator
Create Revit walls within Dynamo with this Python Script.
This script when Run will generate a Wall in Revit. Note that each time it is run a new wall is created, i.e. if run with the same location and length properties, it will create another wall in that same location, and for each consecutive run. Enjoy!
